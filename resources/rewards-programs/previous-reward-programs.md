# Previous Reward Programs

### Sif's Harvest & Sif's Bloom: Liquidity Mining Program

We are excited to inform you of a new Liquidity Mining program launching October 4th, 2021, aptly named **Sif’s Harvest**. We have learned a lot from running our previous reward programs, and we designed this one with very careful consideration to ensure we were going to achieve the results that will help propel Sifchain.

Our goal for this program is to put daily active user count on an exponential growth curve while encouraging adding of liquidity across all pools by offering great APY that is spread over a 6 week time-frame. We will encourage users to frequently engage in DEX activity by allowing them to claim and re-pool their rewards at no penalty to realize compounded gains.

**Key facts around this upcoming Liquidity Mining program are below. We are simplifying the process, while enabling participants to earn more:**

1. Liquidity Providers will have _no_ lockup period
2. Claim rewards at any time (Payouts for claims made weekly on Fridays)
3. fLPs will expect a highly-competitive APY percentage
4. All pools are eligible
5. The LM program will run for six (6) weeks

**Impermanent Loss Mitigation**\
We have implemented an Impermanent Loss (IL) Mitigation. If a user realizes IL, the user will continue to earn rewards based on the realized IL amount. These values are based on the Rowan value of a user’s add. For example, imagine a user deposits 50K Rowan and 50K Rowan worth of USDT for a total of 100K Rowan worth of assets into a Sifchain liquidity pool. Let’s say this amount drops to 80K worth of Rowan due to price fluctuations. The user removes all 80K Rowan worth of assets. That user will continue to earn LM rewards based off of the 20K Rowan worth of assets that was lost due to IL (the 20k here is called the ‘IL amount’). The IL amount ONLY comes into play if a user removes their liquidity and realizes IL. If that user were to add additional liquidity after realizing this IL, their LM Reward eligibility amount would be the sum of their IL amount + any added liquidity amounts.

**FAQs:**

* **Which pools are eligible for me to earn rewards from?** EVERY pool listed in the Sifchain DEX!
* **When does this program start?** It starts on October 3rd 5:30pm PST. This means that you will earn rewards on any and all liquidity you add starting on October 4th and going until the end of the program.
* \*\*When does the program end? \*\*The program will run for 6 weeks. This means its end date will be: November 12th, 2021.
* **How do I earn these rewards?** Simply add liquidity to any of our pools and that is it. Visit our Rewards page in the DEX to watch your rewards grow.
* **How do I claim my rewards? Are there any penalties for claiming them?** You can claim your rewards by going into the Sifchain DEX and going to the Rewards tab. Here you will be able see how many rewards you have earned and the ability to claim them. No, you are not penalized for claiming early! With that being said: If you claim on Wednesday (for example), it locks your rewards to be claimed for that week at that amount. Your non-pending claim rewards will continue to accrue, but those rewards will not be claimable until the current pending claim has been paid out. SO if you are wanting to maximize your rewards that you are claiming each week, you should claim come **Friday early morning PST (before 8am PST)**
* **When are claimed rewards paid out?** Claims will be processed each week and distribution will occur on Friday evenings PST. When these rewards are distributed, they will get automatically sent to your wallet. You are now free to use these any way you see fit (like adding them back into a liquidity pool!).
* **How much am I expected to earn by participating in this program?** We are aiming at a 345% APY. We may increase the reward pool in hopes to stay around this percentage. This will be based upon various market factors, strategic goals, and how Sifchain progresses over the duration of this program. The goal is to stay at a highly-competitive APY percentage to attract and maintain liquidity providers, while ensuring to build value in Sifchain and the $ROWAN token.
* **What if I have pending rewards in the .42 Liquidity Mining Program and Sif's Harvest Liquidity Mining program?** If you want to claim your rewards, you will need to claim ALL of your rewards (hence why there is only 1 claim button now).
* \*\*If I add any liquidity before the program start, will that be eligible for these rewards? \*\*No, only liquidity adds from the start of the program and until the end date of the program will be eligible to earn rewards.

### .42 Liquidity Mining Program

With the introduction of .42 and IBC within Sifchain, we have decided to launch a special Liquidity Mining program (one that we are calling the 'IBC LM program'). The rules, and important details of this program are as follows:

* We will be using the same concepts of our .39 Liquidity Mining Program (as outlined [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/resources/rewards-programs/additional-information-.39-lm-vs-program)). This explains our usage of tickets and ticket multipliers, a global bucket, claiming your rewards, impacts of withdrawing liquidity, and IL protection.
* The total global bucket amount for this program will be 10,000,000 ROWAN. This bucket will be used as the single bucket across all eligible pools.
* The eligibility window will be set to 6 weeks, starting on August 24, 2021. This means any liqudity added to our eligible pools within this time frame will earn rewards.
* The full maturation time period is also set to 6 weeks as well.
  * For example:
    * If you add on eligible liquidity on day 1, you will earn rewards for 6 weeks and full maturation will occur at 6 weeks.
    * If you add eligible liquidity on week 5, you will earn rewards for 1 week, and still have 6 week maturation period from the time you added.
* The eligible pools are all CosmosSDK tokens on IBC (ex: Atom, DVPN, AKT, etc.). This means if you add any liquidity to ANY of these pools, you will be eligible to earn rewards.

**Summary of eligibility requirements:**

* A user will be eligible to receive these rewards IF they add liquidity to any Sifchain <> Cosmos Asset pool. As we add new Comos tokens to the DEX, those will also automatically be included as well.
* A user will be eligible to receive these rewards IF they add liquidity during the eligibility window. This window is set for 6 weeks starting on August 24, 2021.
* A user will earn full maturity of their rewards once they keep the associated liquidity in 6 weeks.
* If a user removes liquidity from an IBC pool, this will be treated as a normal remove liquidity event and subject to our ticket burning logic (as outlined [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/resources/rewards-programs/additional-information-.39-lm-vs-program)).
* If a user withdraws ANY of their liquidity across ANY pool and is receiving any rewards from the legacy .39 program, they will be subject to forfeiting all their .39 rewards (as outlined [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/resources/rewards-programs/additional-information-.39-lm-vs-program)).

**Claiming**

* Come the 2nd week of the program, users will be eligible to claim their rewards in the DEX UI. They can do this by navigating to the 'Rewards' page in the DEX and click the claim button.
* All claimed rewards will be paid out at the end of the week. This means that if you were to submit a claim request for your claimable rewards, that request will be processed on Friday or Saturday of that week, unless specified by the Sifchain team.

**Recommendations:**

* You should not remove ANY liquidity across ANY pool if you are receiving .39 rewards. If you do so, you are subject to the DQ rules of that program.
* We HIGHLY recommend that anyone that is interested in the new IBC LM program to pool new liquidity. Do not remove any as-is liquidity to move to the new IBC LM eligible pools.

### Sif's Fields of Gold Trading Competition

We would like to announce the **Sif’s Fields of Gold** trading competition that will kick-off on October 25th!\
\
Our goal for this program is to continue to put daily user count on an exponential growth curve while generating increased \
\
This competition will encourage anyone and everyone to swap on the Sifchain DEX, compete, and earn $ROWAN by doing so! This competition will ideally generate high values of system income paid to liquidity providers in the form of swap fees, and to node operators and delegators as transaction fees. So make sure you add liquidity, stake, or do both!

We are also going to have additional reward pools for users who swap the most against specific pools. These are going to be sponsored by the relevant token’s project and the associated rewards will be paid out in their token! This means you can earn $ROWAN and other tokens by participating in this competition! More on these sponsorships below!\
\
Finally, we are planning to run a multi-day live stream with this event! The live stream will include various discussions with Sifchain Core team members. If you are interested in joining the live stream, please sign-up via the link below to be notified of the stream schedule and various discussion topics!

**Some key facts around Sif’s Fields of Gold are below:**

1. Agreement with the below terms are required to participate, including receiving rewards. Participation without accepting the waiver will exclude you from receiving rewards. Terms and Conditions: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DLfNTfB1lTvxQVW-NchX81w-fSDt4O65W6CsHyqLIBQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DLfNTfB1lTvxQVW-NchX81w-fSDt4O65W6CsHyqLIBQ).&#x20;

2. The competition will last for 30 days: From October 25th - November 23rd.
3. There will be two different leaderboards:
   1. Based on total volume swapped over these 30 days (normalized in USDT).
   2. Based on total number of swaps over these 30 days
4. Users will be able to see their position in each leaderboard via a scoreboard on the Sifchain DEX.
5. The top 30 addresses in each leaderboard will be awarded prizes.
6. The total reward pool for the Leaderboard - based on Total Volume: 3,000,000 ROWAN
7. The total reward pool for the Leaderboard - based on Total Number of Swaps: 1,000,000 ROWAN
8. The payout determination for the ‘Leaderboard - based on Total Volume’ will be based upon the percentage of the pie each user in the top 30 owns of that top 30. For example:
   1. ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-10-20 at 11.47.33 AM.png>)
9. The payout determination for the ‘Leaderboard - based on Number of Swaps’ will be pre-determined by placement for those in the top 30. The payout structure is as follows:
   1. ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-10-20 at 11.47.13 AM.png>)
10. ALL trades against ALL pools are considered eligible.
11. We will also have extra rewards for specific project-sponsored pools. This means that you can earn additional rewards by swapping the most against these pools, and these rewards will be paid out in non-ROWAN tokens from the sponsored project. More details on this to come closer to the launch of the competition!
12. We encourage users to keep adding liquidity to our pools to earn swap fees from this competition.
13. We encourage users to keep staking and delegating ROWAN to earn transaction fees during this competition.
14. Sifchain currently has an [SDK](https://github.com/sifchain/clientsdk) that can be utilized for this trading competition programmatically.
15. We will hold a multi-day live stream during this trading competition with dedicated topics to be discussed and lead by the Sifchain Core team.

## .39 Liquidity Mining and Validator Subsidy Rewards on Sifchain

Liquidity mining rewards are rewards given for adding liquidity in the Sifchain [liquidity pool subsystem](https://docs.sifchain.finance/roles/liquidity-providers), whereas validator subsidy rewards are provided for staking or [delegating](https://docs.sifchain.finance/roles/delegators) to the [validator subsystem](https://docs.sifchain.finance/roles/validators).

#### Liquidity Mining & Validator Subsidy Rewards Introduction

Sifchain is running a liquidity mining program. There are 45 million ROWAN being initially allocated to this current rewards program. The eligibility window for the program started on Feb 19, 2021 and is set to end on June 30, 2021. All liquidity and stake that is added to Sifchain during the eligibility window will be eligible for LM and VS Rewards. Rewards will continue to accrue up until August 4th, 2021 (regardless if a user has added liquidity early or late).

For LM rewards, the total rewards in the program are split between the different liquidity providers based on the proportion of total liquidity in the system that they have been providing over the duration of the program. For VS rewards, the total rewards in the program are split between the different users who have provided stake or delegations. Their total possible reward grows the longer they keep their liquidity in the system, up to a maximum of 4 months.

#### Updates to our LM and VS Program, valid as of July 27, 2021

* On the very last block of .39 before we migrate to .42, we will take a snapshot of the current state of participants within the LM/VS program. This snapshot will include:
  * Reward Type: LM or VS
  * Each participant's total claimable amount as of August 4th
  * Each participant's total fully projected amount as of August 4th
  * Each participant's full maturation date
    * Significance of the August 4th date: This is the date when rewards stop accruing. So by choosing this date for the claimable and fully projected amount, we ensure that all users have the ability to be paid out in full.
* We will use this information to determine a payment schedule for each participant.
* First, we determine each participant's **Payment Schedule dates**. We will have 3 various 'Payout Schedules' that a participant can fall into, as determined based on their full maturation date. Those payout schedules are as follows:
  * Payout Schedule #1: Full Maturation Date falls before September 1. Payout Dates:
    * August 6
    * August 13
  * Payout Schedule #2: Full Maturation Date falls between: September 1 - October 1. Payout Dates:
    * August 6
    * August 13
    * August 20
    * August 27
    * September 3
    * September 10
  * Payout Schedule #3: Full Maturation Date falls between October 1 - End of the program. 12 Payout Dates:
    * August 6
    * August 13
    * August 20
    * August 27
    * September 3
    * September 10
    * September 17
    * September 24
    * October 1
    * October 8
    * October 15
* Next, we will determine how much should be paid out to each participant on those dates. To do this, we take the:
  * a) claimable amount as of August 4th (ie: CurrentClaimable) and
  * b) your current outstanding previously claimed amount (ie ClaimedRewardsSinceFinalDispensation) and&#x20;
  * c) total fully projected amount as of August 4th (ie: MaturatedRewardsTotal),

And we create a payment schedule using the following logic:

* MaturatedRewardsTotal - CurrentClaimable = Weekly Regular Distribution Total (wrdTotal).
* We take the wrdTotal and divide that by the number of payment dates to get a per week distribution amount.

We take this per week distribution amount and create a payment schedule as such:

*   First payment schedule date = CurrentClaimable + ClaimedRewardsSinceFinalDispensation +

    &#x20;per week distribution amount.
* Remaining payment schedule dates = per week distribution amount.
* To illustrate the above logic with a few examples:
  * Example Scenario A, Payment Schedule #1:
    * User: sif123
    * Full maturation date = August 20
    * MaturatedRewardsTotal: 125
    * CurrentClaimable: 25
    * WRDTotal: 100
      * Math is MaturatedRewardsTotal - currentClaimable = wrdTotal
    * Payout dates and amounts:
      * August 6 = 25(current claimable amount) + 50(100/2 weeks of WRD)
      * August 13 = 50
  * Example Scenario B, Payment Schedule #2:
    * User: sif456
    * Full maturation date = September 20
    * MaturatedRewardsTotal: 100000
    * CurrentClaimable: 30000
    * WRDTotal: 70000
      * Math is MaturatedRewardsTotal - currentClaimable = wrdTotal
    * Payout dates and amounts:
      * August 6 = 30000(current claimable amount) + 11666(70000/6 weeks of WRD)
      * August 13 = 11666
      * August 20 = 11666
      * August 27 = 11666
      * September 3 = 11666
      * September 10 = 11666
  * Example Scenario C, Payment Schedule #3:
    * User: sif789
    * Full maturation date = October 20
    * MaturatedRewardsTotal: 200000
    * CurrentClaimable: 80000
    * WRDTotal: 120000
      * Math is MaturatedRewardsTotal - currentClaimable = wrdTotal
    * Payout dates and amounts:
      * August 6 = 80000(current claimable amount) + 10909(120000/11 weeks of WRD)
      * August 13 = 10909
      * August 20 = 10909
      * August 27 = 10909
      * September 3 = 10909
      * September 10 = 10909
      * September 17 = 10909
      * September 24 = 10909
      * October 1 = 10909
      * October 8 = 10909
      * October 15 = 10909
* In order to maintain eligibility for this new program and for each payout week, participants must follow the below rules:
  * For LM, a user cannot remove any liquidity at any point before their final payment date.
  * For VS, a user cannot remove any of their stake or undelegate their stake before their final payment date.
  * If a participant does any of the above actions, they have disqualified themselves from future payouts. Participants, if disqualified, will not be eligible to earn any additional payouts from that point forward.
* With these new rules, there will be no need to 'manually claim' any amounts. The distributions will happen automatically on the specified payment schedule dates.
* For additional specific details on exact payout amounts, please reference this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f-ibZyx5O2f1wsNxvi56Kg8fkdys\_DVmwhf7mjKDrDU/edit?usp=sharing) where you can filter by your address and see your specific payout schedule details.
  * Additional help on columns:
    * **Address** - Your sifchain address
    * **reward\_type** - The reward type (either LM or VS)
    * **claimablerewardstotal** - claimable amount as of August 4th
    * **maturatedrewardstotal** - total fully projected amount as of August 4th
    * **maturitydate** - Full maturation date&#x20;
    * **weekly\_regular\_distribution\_total** - MaturatedRewardsTotal - CurrentClaimable = Weekly Regular Distribution Total
    * **per\_week\_distribution\_amount** - Weekly Regular Distribution Total / num\_weeks
    * **num\_weeks** - Number of payment dates as determined by user's maturity date
    * **distribution\_date** - Your determined Payment schedule (see above for these schedules)
    * **claimedrewardssincefinaldispensation** - Your current outstanding previously claimed amount
    *   **firstweekdistribution\_amount** - The amount that will be paid out on your first reward distribution date. This is CurrentClaimable + ClaimedRewardsSinceFinalDispensation +

        &#x20;per week distribution amount.

The below covers how we determined the amounts that were used for user's LM and VS rewards prior to the July 27th 2021 adjustment in our program. Please use the below as additional reference material to help understand the entirety of the .39 LM/VS program.

#### Global bucket

* There can be multiple global reward buckets that each contain ROWAN to be rewarded across a 4-month time period. Initially, we will start with one bucket, but we may periodically top up with additional buckets as the program continues or is extended.
* Reward ROWAN starts off in its global bucket, and as the program progresses will be moved over to individual users as they earn their rewards.
* Participants will generate rewards through their behavior. By the end of each bucket's 4-month drain, its entire ROWAN reward will be drained into user rewards.

#### Tickets

* For the duration of the program, each time a user deposits to a liquidity pool or stakes with validator, a corresponding “ticket” is made. This ticket stores the total ROWAN value of the deposit/stake made, which in turn determines how much ROWAN they will be rewarded. A new ticket is created each time a user pools liquidity or provides stake. Likewise, a proportional amount of tickets are burned each time a user withdraws their liquidity or removes their stake.

**Ticket Multiplier**

* Tickets are non-fungible. Each ticket has a multiplier that grows over time up from 25% to 100%.

**Reward Generation**

* Each time period, each ticket generates rewards from each global bucket on the basis of 1 share per ticket. The rewards are attached to the ticket.

#### Validator Subsidy Rewards: Handling of Delegations

* Any users who provide stake are eligible to earn VS rewards. This includes users who stake and run their own node, as well as users who delegate to a node operator.&#x20;
* When staking your own node, users will earn 100% of the rewards that are associated with the staked amounts.&#x20;
* When delegating to an existing node, users will earn rewards based on the commission rate that the node operator is charging (similar to how block rewards work). As an example: If I am delegating to a node operator that charges 10% commission, all VS rewards that are earned based on my delegation: 90% of those rewards will go to me and 10% of those rewards will go to the node operator.
* For node validators that have earned rewards based on delegations, these rewards have the following stipulations associated with them:
  * These rewards only become claimable when either: a) the delegators claim their portion of these rewards or b) those rewards for those delegators reach full maturity. Once one of these actions happen, these rewards will be considered claimable by the node operator.

**Claiming rewards**

* Users could claim their rewards at any time by resetting their tickets. Whenever a ticket is reset, it will release its rewards to the user based on its current multiplier. Reset tickets then start empty with a 25% multiplier again.

**Withdrawing Liquidity or Stake**

* Whenever a user withdraws their liquidity or stake, they will automatically burn an equivalent amount of tickets to cover the withdrawal. Tickets associated with these rewards will be automatically reset. Again, whenever a ticket is reset, it will release its rewards to the user based on its current multiplier. Reset tickets then start empty with a 25% multiplier again. Tickets will be burned in order from lowest multiplier to highest in order to preserve a user's best tickets with highest multipliers.
* When a user withdraws their liquidity or their stake, it will not automatically submit a claim for the associated rewards. While it will reset those reward tickets, a user will still need to go into the DEX and manually submit a claim transaction to fully claim those rewards.

#### Impermanent Loss Mitigation

We have implemented an Impermanent Loss (IL) Mitigation. If a user realizes IL, the user will continue to earn rewards based on the realized IL amount. These values are based on the Rowan value of a user’s add.

For example, imagine a user deposits 50K Rowan and 50K Rowan worth of USDT for a total of 100K Rowan worth of assets into a Sifchain liquidity pool. Let’s say this amount drops to 80K worth of Rowan due to price fluctuations. The user removes all 80K Rowan worth of assets. That user will continue to earn LM rewards based off of the 20K Rowan worth of assets that was lost due to IL (the 20k here is called the ‘IL amount’). The IL amount ONLY comes into play if a user removes their liquidity and realizes IL. If that user were to add additional liquidity after realizing this IL, their LM Reward eligibility amount would be the sum of their IL amount + any added liquidity amounts.

#### FAQ for LM and VS Rewards Programs

* How much ROWAN has been allocated to each program?
  * 45M ROWAN tokens are allocated to each LM rewards and VS rewards (90M ROWAN in total). Note that the liquidity mining rewards and the validator subsidy rewards are separate, as we encourage people to contribute to both programs as they provide different utilities for the system.
* During which time periods can I add liquidity/stake/delegate and earn rewards?
  * During the program eligibility dates of 02/19/2021 - 06/30/2021. We highly recommend that you add as much as you can during this time period to both our liquidity pools and stake/delegate to earn maximum rewards across both programs.&#x20;
* Can I claim just a portion of my rewards?
  * No. The rewards are automatically disbursed on the set payment dates.
* When can I claim my rewards?
  * No need to claim any rewards! We will dispense them automatically.
* How can I get disqualified?
  * For LM, a user cannot remove any liquidity at any point before their final payment date.
  * For VS, a user cannot remove any of their stake or undelegate their stake before their final payment date.
    * If a participant does any of the above actions, they have disqualified themselves from future payouts. Participants, if disqualified, will not be eligible to earn any additional payouts from that point forward.
* Where can I see my payment schedule?&#x20;
  * You can see details on this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f-ibZyx5O2f1wsNxvi56Kg8fkdys\_DVmwhf7mjKDrDU/edit?usp=sharing).
* How are commission-based rewards handled in this new payout schedule?
  * For validator subsidy rewards that are based on the commission of their delegations: we are assuming that ALL delegators allow their rewards to fully mature, which means that all validators will receive their associated VS rewards based on the assumption that these delegators wait their time (which maximizes the benefit to validators). This will be paid out in a) their 1st week (as a claimable amount if it is considered claimable at this time), and b) will also be split among their future payment schedule.

### Community Token Giveaway

The eligibility for our Community Token Giveaway is now closed. The first 1/4 of tokens have been disbursed. Please refer back here for updates on distribution status.

People who qualified for the airdrop as per the rules of our [community distribution in February](https://medium.com/sifchain-finance/community-distribution-tokens-5dc4b184948e) will receive airdrop tokens in accordance with the new rules.

* Releases will occur on a weekly basis rather than a monthly basis. 1/4th of the expected monthly drop will be released per week for 12 upcoming drops total.
* In order to receive subsequent airdrops, you must pool an amount of liquidity (as measured in Rowan) equal to or greater than 95% of the liquidity you receive during the week after each airdrop. A simple way to meet this criteria is to just pool the airdrop after receiving it although you can pool any asset(s) you like.
* You must not unpool any liquidity from the address receiving the airdrop until the last airdrop has been distributed. Doing so will disqualify you from receiving future airdrops.
* We want clarify that users can pool \*95%\* of their airdrop rather than the entire 100%. This allows users substantial leeway to trade some of the Rowan before pooling.

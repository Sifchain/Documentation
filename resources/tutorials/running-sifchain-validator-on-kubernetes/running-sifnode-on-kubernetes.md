# Running Sifnode on Kubernetes

_This tutorial assumes that you have at least a basic understanding of setting up a user and IAM access keys on your AWS account._

**What is Kubernetes? (k8s)**

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available. Overall costs will depend largely on your final setup.

**Install Dependencies:**

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
